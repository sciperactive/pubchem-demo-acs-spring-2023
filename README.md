# pubchem-demo-acs-spring-2023

This repository was created for a presentation at the American Chemical Society (ACS) Spring 2023 National Meeting in Indianapolis, Inidiana. The presentation demonstrates how to programmatically access PubChem data through its programmatic access interfaces, including PUG-REST, PUG-View, and Entrez-Utilities.  This repository contains the following items:

- **ACS-2023-03-demon.ipynb** :   
      a jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to access PubChem programmatically.  

- **Structure2D_CID_5288826.sdf** :  
    a structure-data file (SDF) used in the above jupyter notebook.  
      
- **./images** :  
    a directory containing the images used in the jupyter notebook.  
    
- **./output_files:**  
    a directory containing output files generated by the jupyter notebook.  
    
- **./cheminformatics_olcc:**  
    a directory containing a series of the jupyter notebooks developed during the Cheminformatics OLCC.  These notebooks are the basis of the Jupyter notebook used in the presentation.
